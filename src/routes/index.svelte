		Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
		Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
		right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
		Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
		mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
		an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
		name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox
		advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
		Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen.
		She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
		the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
		last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
		Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
	</p>
	<p>Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then that was all.</p>
